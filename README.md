# Flags Quiz

## Purpose

The flags quiz game is a fun and educational tool used to test or improve your knowledge of the world’s flags. A flag is displayed to the user and they will have to input the correct country that the flag belongs to. 
The reason for creating this project is for my second milestone project for a software development course I am undertaking with the Code Institute.

## Strategy

As the site owner my goal is to build a game to make learning the flags of the world a fun experience, as when having fun whilst learning is proven to make students more engaged whilst also helping students retain information better because the process is both enjoyable and memorable. 

The target audience of the game is:

- Students of any age who need to know the flags of the world as part of their curriculum.
- Anyone who has an interest in flags of the world and would like to test or improve their knowledge.
- People who are simply looking for something to do and want to play a game.
