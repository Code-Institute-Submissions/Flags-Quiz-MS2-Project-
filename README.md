# Flags Quiz

## Purpose

The flags quiz game is a fun and educational tool used to test or improve your knowledge of the world’s flags. A flag is displayed to the user and they will have to input the correct country that the flag belongs to. 
The reason for creating this project is for my second milestone project for a software development course I am undertaking with the Code Institute.

## Strategy

As the site owner my goal is to build a game to make learning the flags of the world a fun experience, as when having fun whilst learning is proven to make students more engaged whilst also helping students retain information better because the process is both enjoyable and memorable. 

The target audience of the game is:

- Students of any age who need to know the flags of the world as part of their curriculum.
- Anyone who has an interest in flags of the world and would like to test or improve their knowledge.
- People who are simply looking for something to do and want to play a game. 

### Research

I researched several sites offering similar quizzes: 

- [https://flagpedia.net/quiz](https://flagpedia.net/quiz)

Pros | Cons      
---|---
Multiple Choice | Questions are too hard
All 254 flags of the world | Too many multiple-choice options
Tells you which answers you get wrong and right |

Pros | Cons      
---|---
Click only - no typing | Not mobile friendly
Keeps a scrore | Requires lots of scrolling
 Has a timer | No reset

 - [https://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/flags-of-the-world-quiz](https://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/flags-of-the-world-quiz)

 Pros | Cons      
---|---
Tells you stats on your scores | Requires typing input
Has a reset button | Page looks cluttered
Different levels | Gives all the wrong answers at the end – too much information to remember

### User Expectations
 
 The user should:

 -  Be able to navigate the game easily.
 -	Find playing the game enjoyable.
 -	Expect game to load quickly.
 -	Be able to see score.
 -	After providing an incorrect answer be able to see correct answer.
 -	Be able to see an end goal, so that the user will keep playing to the end.


## Scope

Based upon the strategy the features and functionality I want to include are as follows:

-	Single page to keep navigation easy.
-	Fun and vibrant colour scheme.
-	4 Multiple choice answers.
-   Current flag counter so the user knows how far they must go to complete the game.
-	Score counter so the user can see how well they are doing.
-	Provides correct answer so the user can learn and answer correctly next time.
-	Reset Button?
-	The user should be provided with feedback when clicking the answers so that they know an input has been successfully given and weather it is correct or incorrect.
 
 Functionality to leave out:
-	Reset? Game will auto reset on incorrect answer.
-	Different levels?
-	Score stats, beyond my abilities
-	Not all flags of the world- too much for minimal viable product.


## Structure

The site will be structured in a linear format with clean UX keeping the users’ expectations as the main priority.  
The site will be made up of 1 page – all the information will display inside a central box.  
Each question will be asked in the same format with a with the start/ end information and the flags displaying in a central box and 4 multiple choice clickable answers below it.  
A score counter should be at the top of the page.  
The background picture will need to keep things fun at the same time as not being too distracting.

## Skeleton

The page will consist of: 
- A header which will include a reset button, game title and scores.
- A central container which will provide the user with the game information and display the flags.
- 4 buttons below the container for the user to click input the answers.
- A footer which will display social media and developer information.
